      <description>In the ever-evolving field of biomedical research, the extraction of crucial information from scientific texts has become increasingly vital. The Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) project focuses on leveraging state-of-the-art models, specifically BERT and BioBERT, to enhance the identification of named entities in biomedical literature.&#xA;By fine-tuning these powerful models, our goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical information extraction, facilitating researchers and practitioners in quickly obtaining relevant data.</description>
